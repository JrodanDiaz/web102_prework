# WEB102 Prework - *Game Bay*

Submitted by: **Jordan Diaz**

**Game Bay** is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.
* [x] The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.
* [x] The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding
* [x] The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display only unfunded games, only funded games, or all games.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
* [x] Added a "fade in" animation to the game cards.
* [x] Added a background-color and text color transition to the filter buttons, so the user can easily see which option they've         selected.
* [x] Added a jumping anchor that jumps to the "Our Games" section on click.
* [x] Added a search input that changes the jumping anchor's reference to the corresponding game card in the "Our Games" section.
* [x] Slightly modified the layout of the website, and added a media query to clean up the "description" section on smaller screens.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

At first, I tried to use the HTML "onclick" attribute instead of JS eventListeners to give the buttons functionality. I later learnt that the "onclick" attribute doesn't work when the `<script>` is of `type="module"`
